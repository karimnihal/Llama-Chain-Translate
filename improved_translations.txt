A remarkably open and unique picture of Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's documentary feature film.
This unique film created by Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
In late September last year, I received a phone call from Ivanka and Karel Gott, who asked me whether, after ten years, I would consider making another documentary about Karel's life. I didn't hesitate. I felt honored to work with someone who has been a part of the Czech cultural scene for over half a century, thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility, and immense work ethic. I accepted the challenge to make a documentary feature about Karel Gott as a way to repay this legendary singer, who has delighted audiences for generations with his art.
Thanks to our timely agreement and organization, the first day of shooting took place on 22nd October last year, and the last scenes with Karel Gott were shot just a few days ago. The aim has always been clear – to authentically capture Karel Gott, a singer of unparalleled talent who gives himself to his fans, a painter, and a loving husband and father. For sixty years, he has been spreading joy through his songs to multiple generations, not just in this country, but also across Europe and indeed across the entire world. He has captured the hearts of his fans with his authenticity, simply being the man they love.
The film is not supposed to be a highlight reel of Karel Gott's undeniable fame and success. "This is the reason why we can't compare this film to my previous film, The Gott Phenomenon. They are both different. If nothing else, it's different in capturing another life stage of Karel Gott's life, which will be very apparent in his very intimate confession he gave us. This made us realize just what a legend we have had the privilege to work and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
